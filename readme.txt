Artist/Designer Statement:

Kinnectome (alt name: Whisper Spores) is inspired by my fascination with the quiet intelligence of fungi and the unseen forces of nature. 
In folklore,mushrooms often represent portals, communication networks, or signs of fairy activity. 
With this project, I wanted to imagine how a single mushroom might respond to invisible changes in its environment—almost like it's breathing or listening.

A living, feeling network — not just nodes and data, but memories, empathy, ancestral knowledge.

The idea that mycelium, neural pathways, and digital systems all mirror one another in structure and function.

A community consciousness — one that is interwoven through nature, code, and collective memory.

A speculative future or alt-present where fungal networks and machine networks might listen, archive, or speak.
